# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The manual measurements feature allows users to manually enter sensor data measurements for their aquaculture devices. This feature enables users to record sensor readings when automatic MQTT sensor data is not available or for verification purposes. The system provides comparison capabilities between manual measurements and real-time sensor data from MQTT to help users validate their manual entries against actual sensor readings.

## Requirements

### 1. Manual Measurement Data Entry
**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually enter sensor measurements for my devices so that I can record data when automatic sensors are not available or for verification purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the manual measurement entry form THEN they SHALL be able to enter temperature, pH, TDS, and DO level values
2. WHEN a user submits manual measurements THEN the system SHALL validate all sensor values against acceptable ranges
3. WHEN a user enters manual measurements THEN the system SHALL record the measurement timestamp and user information
4. WHEN a user submits manual measurements THEN the system SHALL store the data in a separate manual_measurements table
5. WHEN a user enters invalid sensor values THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation error messages
6. WHEN a user submits manual measurements THEN the system SHALL verify device ownership and access permissions

### 2. Manual Measurement Data Retrieval
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my manual measurements so that I can track my recorded data over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user requests manual measurements THEN the system SHALL return paginated results with sorting capabilities
2. WHEN a user filters manual measurements by date range THEN the system SHALL return measurements within the specified period
3. WHEN a user filters manual measurements by device THEN the system SHALL return measurements for the specified device only
4. WHEN a user views manual measurements THEN the system SHALL display measurement values, timestamps, and user information
5. WHEN a user requests manual measurements THEN the system SHALL enforce device access permissions
6. WHEN a user views manual measurements THEN the system SHALL provide export capabilities for the data

### 3. Real-time Sensor Data Comparison
**User Story:** As a user, I want to compare my manual measurements with real-time sensor data so that I can validate the accuracy of my manual entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user requests measurement comparison THEN the system SHALL lookup sensor data from the same timestamp as the manual measurement
2. WHEN real-time sensor data exists for the comparison timestamp THEN the system SHALL calculate the difference between manual and sensor values
3. WHEN no real-time sensor data exists for the comparison timestamp THEN the system SHALL find the closest available sensor reading within a configurable time window
4. WHEN displaying comparison results THEN the system SHALL show manual values, sensor values, and percentage differences
5. WHEN comparison differences exceed configurable thresholds THEN the system SHALL flag potential discrepancies
6. WHEN generating comparison reports THEN the system SHALL provide statistical analysis of manual vs sensor accuracy

### 4. Data Validation and Quality Control
**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to validate my manual measurements so that I can ensure data quality and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user enters manual measurements THEN the system SHALL validate values against biological and technical sensor ranges
2. WHEN manual measurements are significantly different from recent sensor readings THEN the system SHALL warn the user about potential inconsistencies
3. WHEN a user submits duplicate manual measurements for the same timestamp THEN the system SHALL prevent or handle duplicate entries appropriately
4. WHEN manual measurements are entered THEN the system SHALL log all validation results and user actions
5. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for corrective actions
6. WHEN generating data quality reports THEN the system SHALL include manual measurement accuracy metrics

### 5. Integration with Existing System
**User Story:** As a user, I want manual measurements to integrate seamlessly with the existing sensor system so that I can use both data sources together.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN manual measurements are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity with existing device and user entities
2. WHEN manual measurements are retrieved THEN the system SHALL use the same authentication and authorization mechanisms as sensor data
3. WHEN manual measurements are displayed THEN the system SHALL follow the same response formats and API patterns as sensor data
4. WHEN manual measurements are created THEN the system SHALL emit real-time events to connected WebSocket clients
5. WHEN manual measurements are processed THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing error handling and logging systems
6. WHEN manual measurements are accessed THEN the system SHALL respect user roles and device ownership permissions

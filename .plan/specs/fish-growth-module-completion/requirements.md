3. WHEN device access validation fails THEN the system SHALL log security events and return appropriate forbidden responses
4. WHEN calculation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error context and continue processing with safe defaults
5. WHEN external service calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with proper retry mechanisms
6. WHEN concurrent access issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle database conflicts appropriately

### Requirement 5: Data Export and Reporting Capabilities
**User Story:** As a user, I want to export fish growth data in various formats for external analysis and reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I request data export for a specific time range THEN the system SHALL provide filtered export functionality
2. WHEN I request data export for specific devices THEN the system SHALL support multi-device export with proper organization
3. WHEN I request data export in CSV format THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted CSV with headers
4. WHEN I request data export in Excel format THEN the system SHALL provide structured Excel workbook with multiple sheets
5. WHEN I request data export with analytics THEN the system SHALL include summary statistics and visualizations
6. WHEN I request scheduled exports THEN the system SHALL support automated export generation and delivery

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization and Caching
**User Story:** As a user, I want fast response times when accessing fish growth data and analytics.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I request fish growth data for large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement proper pagination and filtering
2. WHEN I request frequently accessed analytics THEN the system SHALL implement caching to improve response times
3. WHEN I perform bulk operations on fish growth data THEN the system SHALL optimize database queries for performance
4. WHEN I access historical data spanning long periods THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data retrieval strategies
5. WHEN multiple users access the same device data THEN the system SHALL optimize concurrent access patterns
6. WHEN the system processes analytics calculations THEN the system SHALL implement background processing for complex computations

### Requirement 7: Testing Coverage and Quality Assurance
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage for the fish growth module to ensure reliability and maintainability.

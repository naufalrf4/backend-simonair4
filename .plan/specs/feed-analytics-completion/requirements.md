# Requirements Document

## Introduction
The feed module in the backend-simonair project requires a comprehensive analytics feature to provide users with valuable insights into feed consumption, efficiency, and its correlation with fish growth. The current implementation is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with a robust solution that includes detailed calculations, data validation, and clear presentation of analytics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Feed Analytics
**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand the effectiveness of my feeding strategy by analyzing feed consumption and its impact on fish growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I request feed analytics for a device THEN the system SHALL calculate and return the Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR).
2. WHEN I request feed analytics THEN the system SHALL provide total feed consumed over a specified period.
3. WHEN I request feed analytics THEN the system SHALL correlate feed data with fish growth data to determine feed efficiency.
4. WHEN I request feed analytics THEN the system SHALL identify feeding patterns (e.g., daily average, feeding times).
5. WHEN I request analytics THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the most and least consumed feed types.

### Requirement 2: Data Validation and Sufficiency
**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to inform me if there is not enough data to generate meaningful analytics.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I request feed analytics with insufficient feed or growth data THEN the system SHALL return a clear message indicating that more data is needed.
2. WHEN I submit feed data THEN the system SHALL validate the `feed_type` to be either 'natural' or 'artificial'.
3. WHEN calculating analytics THEN the system SHALL handle entries with missing or invalid data gracefully by excluding them from calculations.

### Requirement 3: Integration with Device and Fish Growth Data
**User Story:** As a user, I want the feed analytics to be seamlessly integrated with my device and fish growth information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I request feed analytics THEN the system SHALL validate that I have access to the specified device.
2. WHEN calculating feed efficiency THEN the system SHALL accurately retrieve corresponding fish growth data for the same period.
3. WHEN a device is deleted THEN the system SHALL ensure that associated feed data is handled according to the defined data retention policy.

### Requirement 4: API and Data Presentation
**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want a clear and well-documented API endpoint for feed analytics that returns data in a structured and understandable format.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I call the feed analytics endpoint THEN the response SHALL be in a structured JSON format.
2. WHEN I review the API documentation THEN the feed analytics endpoint, its parameters, and the response schema SHALL be clearly documented in Swagger/OpenAPI.
3. WHEN I receive the analytics response THEN it SHALL include a summary section with human-readable insights.
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the API SHALL return a standard error response format with a descriptive message.
